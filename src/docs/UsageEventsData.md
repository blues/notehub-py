## Example

```python
from notehub_py.models.usage_events_data import UsageEventsData

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of UsageEventsData from a JSON string
usage_events_data_instance = UsageEventsData.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(UsageEventsData.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
usage_events_data_dict = usage_events_data_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of UsageEventsData from a dict
usage_events_data_from_dict = UsageEventsData.from_dict(usage_events_data_dict)
```
